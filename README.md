# Dragon Core - The trpg game engine

Dragon Core was first made for a textual dragon ball game. Based on a school projet that I had.
The goal of this school project was to implement as much as design pattern as possible. And create a game with that.

From now, I will like to continue building the **engine** part of this game that can be found [@dbz-explorer](https://github.com/nak0x/dbz-explorer).

I will want now to say that, this projet is made in python, and I already know that python is not made for that, and I'm thinking of a remake in a more adapted lang such as Rust or Ruby.
